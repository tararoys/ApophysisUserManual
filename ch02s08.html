Saving Parameters
</h2></div></div></div><p>I am going to digress a bit and tell you how to save fractal parameters.  If you know this already, skip to the next section.
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="grandjulians/images/filesaveparameters.jpg"></div><p> To save parameters, go to file, save parameters.  (or type ctrl-s).  A dialog like the one below will pop up. 
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="grandjulians/images/saveparametersdialog.jpg"></div><p>
There's a few things you should know about the Save Parameters dialog that are kind of tricky.  In most programs, when you save a file, it will save that file somewhere on your computer.  In this dialog you would think that the name of the file would be 'diamond2'  This is not the case.  Instead, it will save "diamond2" as part of a list of fractals that are stored in the file renders.flame.  If you want to know where diamond2 went when you hit save, it is somewhere in the renders.flame file.
</p><p>
If you want to change which .flame file diamond2 is saved to, click on the 'browse' button 
<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="grandjulians/images/browsefiles.jpg"></span>
 The Browse Files dialog will be brought up. 
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="grandjulians/images/browsefilesdialog.jpg"></div><p>
In the file name field

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="grandjulians/images/filenamefield.jpg"></div><p>
, type the name of the file that you want your fractal saved to.  For example, type 'renders2'.  Click the save button. 

<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="grandjulians/images/savebutton.jpg"></span>
This will tell Apophysis that you want to save your parameter into the file renders2.flame.  (by the way, .flame is the filename extension of all the fractal lists make by Apophysis.  If you see a file with a .flame extension, Apophysis made that file)
</p><p>
Back in the save parameters dialog, this will change the path name in the file name field so that it saves to renders2.flame.  Depending on how big your full pathname is, you might have to scroll to the right to see the renders2.flame part.

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="grandjulians/images/filenamefieldinsaveparameterdialog.jpg"></div><p>  The file name in this field is technically called the full pathname of the file, because it shows exactly what drive and what folders on that drive the file is saved in.  If you want to change folders, or even the name of the file that you are saving the parameters to, you can change parts of this full pathname.  However, if you don't want to change where it is saved, do not change any part of the full pathname.  If you add even a single space in there, the fractal will save either save to someplace you don't expect or tell you that it cannot be saved.    
</p><p>
Anyway, why does Apophysis save lists of fractals instead of individual fractals?  It has to do with the fact that most users of Apophysis make hundreds, if not thousands, of different fractals in their quest to make the prettiest or most interesting fractal they can.  If Apophysis saved individual fractals, your computer would quickly become littered with thousands of very small files. 
</p><p> 
   Even though you can only work with one fractal at once in Apophysis, maybe you want a history of the different changes you made to a fractal.  By saving them in a list, Apophysis lets you see the previous fractals you worked on quickly and easily.  That is what the left-hand list of fractals is in the main window- a list of fractals you have previously saved, which are easily accessible by clicking on them.  As you can see from the image below, I have just saved diamond 2 into my list of fractals.
