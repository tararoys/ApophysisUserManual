 Click on the red transform.  Under the transforms tab, set its weight 
<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="weights/images/weight1.jpg"></span>
 to 1.   Click on all of the other transforms, and set their weights to .2.
 <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="weights/images/weight2.jpg"></span>
  Look at the fractal.  </p><p>

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="weights/images/weightpic1.jpg"></div><p>
</p><p>
 Notice how the part of the fractal the red triangle is responsible for suddenly became much more visible.  </p><p>
Go back to the red transform and set its weight to .2.
<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="weights/images/weight2.jpg"></span>
  Now look at the fractal.  All parts of it are equally visible, right?  Right.  </p><p>

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="weights/images/weightpic2.jpg"></div><p>
</p><p>
Now set the red transform's weight to .05.  Notice how the part of the fractal it is responsible for suddenly became less visible.  Interesting, huh?  </p><p>

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="weights/images/weightpic3.jpg"></div><p>
</p><p>
Finally, set the red transform's weight equal to zero.  Wow! It's no longer a Sierpinski's quilt!  Instead, it's a Sierpinski's triangle!  Also note that the weight is no longer set to zero- it's set to a very very small numbers.  Apophysis does not like weights set to zero, so it doesn't allow them.  </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="weights/images/weightpic4.jpg"></div><p>
So what does this all mean?  It means that the value of the weight (and by value I mean the number the weight is set to)  isn't important.  What's important how high or low the value of the weight is compared to the weights of the other transforms.  For example, when we set the red transform's weight high in comparison to the rest of the transform, that part of the fractal became much more visible.  When we set the red transform's weight low in comparison to the weight of the other transforms, it became much less visible.  And when we set that weight to zero, disappeared entirely.  So, repeat after me:  the value of the weight is not important.   The important thing is the value of the transform compared to the value of the weights of the other transforms.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch05.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch05.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch05s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 5.
