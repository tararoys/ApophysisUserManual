Remember MRCM? If not, then go back and review. Variations are simply another, odd step in MRCM.  After each transform is and distorted, it's linear grid is redrawn with the variation's grid. So, every time another iteration of MRCM is run, two things happen on each triangle.  First, the triangle's movements are calculated.  Then, the grid on which the triangle is drawn is distorted, and the triangle is redrawn on that grid.  Needless to say, this causes some funky fractals.  Let's take a look at some examples.  </p><p>

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="variations/images/transformed.jpg"></div><p>

</p><p>
This is a fractal with two transforms.  It has a linear variation that is set to 1, shown in yellows, and a square variation that is set to one, shown in red.  There are no other variations on either of the transforms.  Note, the size and position of these transforms in relation to the reference triangle, shown in white. It creates a square fractal that looks like this. </p><p>

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="variations/images/fractal.jpg"></div><p>

  </p><p>
 These are the grids that each transform has on it. Recall that in MRCM, these two triangles are the first copies the MRCM makes. </p><p>

 </p><p>
 What does each transform do?  The linear transform does exactly what a linear transform normally does:  it makes a copy of the entire fractal and maps it on the linear grid.  However, the sinusoidal one is the strange one.  It makes a copy of the entire fractal and maps it onto the sinusoidal grid.  Since the sinusoidal grid is restricted to a square, the fractal comes out squarish.  Let me attempt to show you how this works, below.  The picture below is the copy of the fractal that the red triangle makes during MRCM.  It does NOT include the copy of the fractal that the yellow triangle makes.  </p><p>
 
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="variations/images/sinvar2.jpg"></div><p>

</p><p>
The red transform makes a copy of the entire fractal, and blows it up 200 percent.  The blue triangle is a copy of the sinusoidal triangle, and the purple triangle is a copy of the linear triangle.  However, look at the red triangle's grid.  After the blue and purple copies are made, these copies must be squished down so that they fit inside of that red square, as shown below.  </p><p>
 
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="variations/images/sinvar3.jpg"></div><p>

</p><p>
 So what does the linear transform do?  The linear transform does what linear transforms always do.  They make a copy of the fractal and orient it the same way that the linear transform is oriented, as shown below.</p><p>
 
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="variations/images/linearvar2.jpg"></div><p>

</p><p>
 So there are no restrictions on this copy- it is simply drawn on a linear grid.  However, on the next iteration, the blue transform will copy the entire fractal, and limit it to the box shape.  The purple transform will copy the entire fractal 45 degrees and draw it on a linear grid.  As a result, the linear transform will keep rotating the fractal 45 degrees,  and the sinusoidal transform will keep restricting it to a box.  This is why we end up with an eight-pointed star as our fractal at the end.  </p><p>

  </p><p>
So.  Let's review.  Variations are simply a new step in MRCM.  After the transform is moved, the variation is added on top of it, and distorts it in some way.  Then the process is repeated for every transform every time MRCM is run.  </p><p>
So, that's how, in general, variations work.  </p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch07s02.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch07.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch07s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">What is a Variation? </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Specific Variations</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
