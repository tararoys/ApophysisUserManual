complex fractal from deep in fractal history. This fractal is
called a Barnsley's fern, because it was created by Barnsley and it
looks like a fern. Funny how that works, eh?</p><p></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmintro/images/btriangle1.jpg"></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmintro/images/btriangle2.jpg"></div><p>Here's the base triangle, and the second
iteration. Note how the first triangle is only slightly smaller
than the base triangle, is move up, and is rotated slightly left.
The second and third triangles are mirrors of each other, and are a
strange shape. The fourth triangle is so thin it might as well be a
line.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmintro/images/btriangle2.jpg"></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmintro/images/btriangle3.jpg"></div><p>Now, let's look at the third iteration, and
compare it to the second iteration. Let's take a look at the second
iterations' red triangle. Since the second iteration is slightly
rotated, the red triangles of the third iteration will be rotated
the same amount. It will also be slightly smaller than the triangle
it is using as a base. Note that in the third iteration there are
four red triangles, one for each of the triangles in the previous
iteration.</p><p>Now let's look at in the green triangle,
i.e. the right-hand leaf. It is not only rotated, but is stretched
to be fairly skinny. That means all of the triangles in the third
iteration using this triangle as a reference will also be stretched
into a skinny triangle. There are also four of them, in the third
iteration, one for each of the triangles in the previous
iteration</p><p>The purple triangle is the same as the
second triangle, except for one important feature- it is mirrored.
It is this purple triangle that gives the fern its symmetry. Note
in the third iteration how the branch that grew from the left-hand
leaf (the green triangle) in the second iteration is mirrored when
compared to the rest of the branches.</p><p>Finally, take a look at the blue triangle.
It is essentially a skinny line. It shrinks into progressively
smaller skinny lines.</p><p></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmintro/images/btriangle1.jpg"></div><p> </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmintro/images/btriangle2.jpg"></div><p> </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmintro/images/btriangle3.jpg"></div><p> </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmintro/images/btriangle4.jpg"></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmintro/images/btriangle5.jpg"></div><p>So where does this all lead? To Barnsley's
fern. As you can see, iterated function systems can get pretty
complicated, pretty quick. However, the transform editor is based
off of IFS, so knowing how they work is a huge key to unlocking the
secrets of Apophysis.</p><p></p><p>Now, note that these two examples were
linear fractals. This is because it is easiest to see how iterated
function systems work with linear fractals. I completely ignored
the other variations. Well- to be fair, I didn't completely
ignore them. I am saving them for another tutorial, because they do
strange and funky things to the fractal, and it is difficult to
explain variations and MRCM at the same time.)</p><p>So, enjoy Apophysis until next
time!</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch03.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 3.
