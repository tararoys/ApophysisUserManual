 Introduction</h2></div></div></div><p>
 
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="linearfractals/images/plan7.jpg"></div><p>

</p><p>
  A tutorial for all versions of Apophysis </p><p>
This tutorial explains more than you ever wanted to know about linear fractals.  Why linear fractals?  Because they're easy, and have only linear variations.  This tutorial is the set-up for the next tutorial, which will explain more than you ever wanted to know about variations.  So sit back, and let's do some linear fractal-making.   </p><p>
  You probably already know how to move triangles around in the transform editor.  Moving them, stretching them, flipping them, and rotating them create strange and odd fractals.  But what do the movements do, and why do they do it?  Fear not, this tutorial shall explain all! </p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2804927"></a>
 Scaling
 </h3></div></div></div><p>
All right.  There are five different things you can do to a triangle around in the transform editor.  You can translate it, rotate it, reflect it, scale it, or shear it.  I shall explain what each does presently.  </p><p>
 Remember MCRM?  If not, review the chapter on Multiple Copy Reduction Machines. Remember, in MCRM, we start with a single triangle, and make copies of it.  What happens with we just make one copy, and don't do anything to it?  We don't change it's size, we don't change its position, we don't, in fact, change anything.  Let's copy it five times and see, all right?</p><p>

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="linearfractals/images/mcrm1.jpg"></div><p>

  </p><p>
 Right.  Nothing happened.  Why?  Well, because we're just copying the same thing over and over and over.  So that's what happens when we don't do anything to it.  Now, let's do something to it and see what happens.  </p><p>
Let's start by changing it's size.  Changing the size of the triangle is called scaling. In other words, scaling means to make the triangle larger or smaller.  So, let's run another MCRM.  This time, let us make one copy of the triangle and shrink it by half.  Use the scale button, set to 200, to scale the triangle down by half. 
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="linearfractals/images/scale.jpg"></div><p>

   </p><p>

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="linearfractals/images/mcrm2.jpg"></div><p>

  </p><p>
 So what happens?  It gets smaller.  In fact, it eventually shrinks down to a point.  Not very interesting, but this is key to creating more fractals.  Remember, smaller triangles create smaller copies of themselves on every step- and when combined with the other ways of moving a triangle, will create beautiful fractals.  </p><p>
 Let's run one more MCRM, to illustrate another concept.  Now, make one copy of the triangle.  Instead of making it smaller, let's make it bigger on each step.  What happens?</p><p>

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="linearfractals/images/mcrm3.jpg"></div><p>

  </p><p>
 Well, obviously, this fractal blows up.  This triangle will keep increasing forever, creating a not very interesting image at all.  </p><p>
 Remember this:  triangles larger than the reference triangle make uninteresting fractals.  Triangles smaller than the reference triangle create interesting fractals. So, we want our triangles to be smaller than the reference triangle, so that they keep shrinking each time we copy the fractal. Got that?  Good. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2805665"></a>Translation</h3></div></div></div><p>

 Now, let's move on to translations, which are the second most important way to move the triangles.  </p><p>
 What are translations?  To translate means to move up down, or side to side.  In other words, translating your triangle means grabbing it and dragging it across the screen.  In Apophysis, you can do this with these buttons, or you can do it manually.  
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="linearfractals/images/translation.jpg"></div><p>

</p><p>
 Now, Make two copies of your triangle.  Scale them down by one half.  Move one above the other, like this:  </p><p>

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="linearfractals/images/plan1.jpg"></div><p>

  </p><p>
 The red triangle is your base triangle.  The white triangles are the two copies.  All right.  Now, let's run our MCRM, and see what happens.  </p><p>

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="linearfractals/images/mcrm4.jpg"></div><p>

  </p><p>
Well, they shrink, and as they shrink, they make copies of each other, eventually forming a line.  See?  Now we're getting somewhere.   </p><p>

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="linearfractals/images/plan2.jpg"></div><p>

</p><p>
 Now, pick one triangle and move it around the screen.  It doesn't do anything very interesting- it just changes the position of the line.  Why?  Well, let's run MRCM and find out.  </p><p>

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="linearfractals/images/mcrm5.jpg"></div><p>

  </p><p>
See?  Even though the triangles are in different positions, they always shrink into a straight line. Depending on how you scale your transforms, this straight line can be a solid line or a dashed line.  Try different poistions and scales, and see what happens.</p><p>
Now, I want to show you something neat.   Reset your transforms so that they are once again scaled down by half compared to the reference triangle.  Copy one of your triangles, and move it to another location, so that your triangles look something like this:   </p><p>

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="linearfractals/images/plan3.jpg"></div><p>

</p><p>
Now, let's run MCRM, and see what happens. </p><p>

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="linearfractals/images/mcrm6.jpg"></div><p>

  </p><p>
 Hey!  It's Serpinski's gasket!  Serpinski's gasket is one of the simplest fractals because it is only made with scaling and translation.  Even the translation doesn't particularly matter- choose one of the triangles, and move it around. You just get stretched out versions of serpeinki's triangle.  Now, if you change the scale, you get a versions of the serpinski's triangle that either overlap or dont touch.  Try it and see!   </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2805839"></a>Rotation</h3></div></div></div><p>
All right.  Delete one of your triangles, and take us back to the straight line.  Now, rotoate one of your triangles counterclockwise, so that your transform editor looks like this. </p><p>

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="linearfractals/images/plan4.jpg"></div><p>

</p><p>
Now we're getting somewhere.  What just happened?  Let's run MCRM to find out.</p><p>

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="linearfractals/images/mcrm7.jpg"></div><p>

</p><p>
 See the blue triangle?  When it makes copies of itself, those copies rotate too, forming those curly branches.  Rotations make all of the really interesting curves in linear fractals. </p><p>
Now, these three movements: Scale, translation, and rotation, are the only ingredients you need to make some interesting fractals.  Let me show you something neat.   </p><p>
 Make one triangle rather large, and make one rather small.  Put their 0 vertices on the 0 vertex of the base rectangle.  Now, rotate the large rectangle counterclockwise.  Yay!  It spins!  Note:  You can make really neat spinning linear fractals with this technique.  </p><p>

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="linearfractals/images/plan5.jpg"></div><p>

</p><p>
While we're at it, let me point out two more things that will make understanding the next two ways of moving the triangle a bit easier.  Look at the fractal below.  It has two transforms.  This is what the final fractal looks like.   </p><p>

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="linearfractals/images/plan6.jpg"></div><p>

</p><p>
 Look at the final fractal, and divide it into two parts, like the picture below.  Note that part 2 one is a smaller  version of the whole fractal.  Since the white triangle is only scaled, and not rotated this makes sense.  Now, look at part 1, in blue.  It is a smaller version of the fractal, rotated about 65 degrees counterclockwise.  It corrosponds to the blue triangle, which is also rotated 65 degrees counterclockwise.  </p><p>

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="linearfractals/images/plan7.jpg"></div><p>

</p><p>
 As you can see, the fractal not only makes copies of itself, but can also tell you how those copies were made.  You can see that part 2 in the fractal is simply a scaling of the whole fractal, while part 1 is a scaling and a rotation of the whole fractal. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2805974"></a>Sheer</h3></div></div></div><p>All right.  Let's move on to shear.  Shear is when a transform is distorted so that it no longer has a ninety degree angle.  Let's shear the left transform of the previous fractal. </p><p>

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="linearfractals/images/plan8.jpg"></div><p>

</p><p>
 See?  It reshapes the fractal. Look at the white triangle.  It corrosponds to the secton of the fractal circled in white.  That section is just a scaled version of the whole fractal.   Now, take a look at the blue section of the fractal.  It is a rotated, squashed, and slightly elongated verions of the whole fractal.  In other words, it is a distorted copy of the whole fractal, and how it is distorted depends on how its corrosponding triangle is sheared.</p><p>
  A few more notes on sheering: stretching and narrowing the triangle tends to make the fractal longer and spikier. while squashing the triangle tends to make it more squat.  Spiky linear fractals tend to have at least one long, skinny triangle.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2806020"></a>Reflection</h3></div></div></div><p>
Finally, we get to the strangest transform:  Reflection.  What does reflection mean?  It means to flip the triangle over- allow me to demonstrate.  Flip this triangle.  </p><p>
Reflections do some odd and interesting things to the fractal.  Let's run an MCRM of this fractal to see exactly what. Let us also divide the fractal into two parts. </p><p>

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="linearfractals/images/mcrm8.jpg"></div><p>

</p><p>
 Note that, on  every step of the MCRM, the reflected transformation flips back and forth.  This makes for a very symmetrical fractal.   In fact, most fractals with reflections are highly symmetrical.  Also, Look at the two parts.  The one circled in white is just the whole fractal, scaled down.  Now, look at the fractal circled in blue. It is a copy of the whole fractal that has been scaled, translated, rotated, and finally, reflected. You can tell it's reflected because the fractal circled in blue looks like a mirrored image of the whole fractal.   </p></div><p>
Allrighty, let's review.  You can two five things to a transform:  you can scale it, you can translate it, you can rotate it, you can sheer it, and you can reflect it.  Using all of these, you can create really neat linear fractals,  This will also give us the basis the next tutorial.  So, until next time, have fun!</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch05s04.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch07.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">How Weights Work: The Chaos Game </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 7.
