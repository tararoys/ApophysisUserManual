The following FAQ shows how I think fractals are covered under copyright law, based on a little research I did into copyright law.  This does not mean a court will agree.  Also, the copyright situations I describe have never been tested in court with fractal images, so if a copyright dispute ever comes up, I don't know what will actually happen.  That said, here's a little intro into fractal copyright.  This also applies only to the United States.</p><p>First of all, what is copyright?</p><p>Say you draw a picture.  You made that picture, so that means you own it.  Copyright states that you, as the owner of that picture, have the right to control how that picture is copied, used, and sold.   Copyright rights are exclusive:  that means that you, as the maker and owner of the picture, are the only one that can decide how the picture is used.  All works that you produce are considered copyrighted unless you specifically give up ownership of the copyright.  </p><p>Section 102, subsection b of copyright law covers this.  <a class="ulink" href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#102" target="_top"> Copyright law </a></p><p>What, rights, exactly, does copyright give to you?   </p><p>
First, copyright gives you the right to control how the image is copied.  So, for example, you render a fractal.  Say you don't want anyone to ever make a copy it.  You have the right to hide that picture away and not permit anyone to copy it.  On the other hand, you also have the right to take that fractal to a printer and print several thousand copies of that fractal.  However, no one else can print several thousand copies of that fractal without your express permission.  You control if and how the image is copied- no one else has the right to do so.  
</p><p>Second, the copyright law gives you the exclusive right to make derivative works based on the original.  So, for example, say you made up an anime character called Giggles.  You, and you alone, have the right to make more works with Giggles.  No one else is permitted to use her as a character.  This makes fanart of Giggles illegal, unless you, as the owner of Giggles, say that it's ok to make fanart of Giggles.</p><p>Third, copyright law gives you, and you alone, the right to sell your works.  Say you rendered a really awesome fractal, and printed out lots of copies of it, and decided to sell them.  Only you can sell them.  No one else has the right to sell them for you, unless you give them permission.  </p><p>Fourth, copyright gives you, and you alone, the right to display your work publicly.  So, if you wanted to hang a picture of your fractal on your door.  You have that right, but no one else has the right to hang a picture of your fractal anywhere unless you tell them it's ok.  </p><p>In essence, Copyright gives you, as the creator, lots and lots of control over how your creation is used.  </p><p>If I don't put a copyright notice on my images, does that mean it is no longer under copyright?  </p><p>NO!  All images are assumed to be under copyright protection unless the author CLEARLY and SPECIFICALLY states that this image is no longer under copyright.  An artist might choose to do this by declaring that the image is in the public domain, which means that anyone can use it for any purpose, or by using a creative commons license, which basically means that anyone can use the image as long as they don't use it for profit.  If you don't see any copyright on the image, ALWAYS assume that the creator still has it under copyright, unless you see a public domain statement or a creative commons license nearby.  </p><p>What does this have to do with Apophysis fractals? </p><p>Apophysis creates two types of output.  First, it creates parameter sets.  These may or may not be copyrightable, and I will explain why in a minute.  Second, it makes renders of fractals:  in other words, it makes pretty fractal pictures.  These ARE copyrightable, because they fall under the "pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works"  that copyright protects.  In essence, any images you create with Apophysis are yours to do with what you will, and any parameter sets that you create can be used by anybody if you post them.  </p><p> So, why are you not sure that parameters are copyrightable?  </p><p>Parameters are a mathematical algorithm that Apophysis uses to create a fractal.   According to section 102, subsection B of US Copyright Law, "In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work."    Parameters fall under the category of both idea and method of operation. Why can't these be copyrighted?  Around the turn of the century, some bright mathematician came up with the idea of copyrighting formulas he developed.  Several scientists tried to follow suit.  Essentially, someone attempted to copyright the law of gravity, so that anytime anyone used it, a royalty would have to be paid.  </p><p>This was, of course, stupid.  The United States Congress amended copyright law to be more sensible.  So, since Apophysis parameters are logic, part of an algorithm, and inputs to a mathematical formula, all of which are both ideas and principles, they are not covered by copyright. <a class="ulink" href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#102" target="_top"> Copyright law </a>=  </p><p>However, Apophysis parameter sets can also be condidered source code. Source code.  Source code is the code used to make programs, and it is copyrightable to a certain extent. Source code is rather like the English language:  You can't copyright individual words, but if you write a book, you can copyright they way you wrote the book. Apophysis parameter sets may fall under this category of material: you can't copyright the parts used to make the parameter set, but you can copyright the parameter set as a whole.</p><p>If someone posts parameters, can I legally use them without their permission?   </p><p>Maybe. It depends on whether parameter sets are considered mathematical formula or source code.  There has never been a court case to determine this, so as a result, using other people's parameter sets without their permission gets onto, as far as I can tell, fuzzy legal ground.  </p><p>However, it is considered impolite in the Apophysis community to use parameters without crediting the person who originally developed them.  Parameters usually take a long time to develop, and, while they are legally available for use, we all like to get credit for our hard work.    </p><p>Also, you can get into trouble for taking a parameter set and rendering an image from it that looks exactly like an image that someone already posted, and therefore, copyrighted.  So, when you get a parameter set, it is a VERY good idea to change it around at least a little, so that it does not look too much like the original parameter set.  Now, there are a lot of fractals out there that look very similar, because that is the nature of fractal art.    As a result, you probably wouldn't run into too much trouble.  However, it is again, considered impolite to use someone's parameter set and not bother to change any of the details.  </p><p>Since Apophysis is free software, doesn't that mean that everything created with Apophysis is free to anyone? </p><p>NO!  Apophysis is a tool, like a pen or a pencil.  If someone gives you a pencil, that does not mean that everything created with that pencil is therefore free.  Copyright gives you protection of a work regardless of what tools are used to create it.  </p><p> If I take someone's rendering of an Apophysis fractal and change the colors of it, does that make the fractal mine?  </p><p>No.  What you did was make a derivative work.  If it is still recognizable as being a slightly changed copy of the original work, then you have violated that artist's copyright.  In order to avoid problems, you would have to change the image so much that the original fractal is no longer recognizable.  And then you'd have to never tell anyone that you made it with a copyrighted fractal, in order to avoid legal trouble.    </p><p>However, this only applies to manipulating images  produced by Apophysis.  If you slightly changed a parameter set, then you're not violating copyright, because you derived the fractal from a parameter set.  This is legal because parameter sets are not copyrightable.  In order to stay out of trouble, I would recommend always saving your parameters sets.  </p><p>Even if you did use a copyrighted image, however, it is unlikely that you would get in trouble, provided that the fractal is not an exact copy of the original.  Fractals are often so similar to each other that it is difficult to tell whether two similar fractals were generated from a set of parameters or from manipulating a copyrighted image of a fractal in a program like Photoshop.   Be that as it may, it is still illegal, not to mention exceedingly impolite, to use someone's copyrighted fractal images without getting their permission.   </p><p>For more information on copyright, see <a class="ulink" href="http://www.copyright.gov" target="_top">http://www.copyright.gov</a> </p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch11s03.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch13.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Advanced Animation </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 13.
