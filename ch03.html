of the Apophysis transform editor.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmintro/images/transformeditor.jpg"></div><p>When most people look at the Apophysis
transform editor, their first thought is this: Triangles? What the
heck? Rest assured, ladies and gentlemen, I shall explain the
triangles, and why they are there.</p><p>But first, let's look at Sierpinski triangle!
Sierpinski was a mathematician that came up with one of the first
fractals. It is an example of an iterated function system, and of a
Multiple Reduction Copy Machine, or MRCM. What, you might ask, is
an iterated function system (IFS), and an MRCM? Well, and MRCM
makes IFS. Confused yet? Let me explain!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmintro/images/triangle.jpg"></div><p>Start with a right triangle that looks like
the above triangle. This is the first step- it is also called the
first iteration triangle. Iteration, by the way, means to go step
by step.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmintro/images/triangle2.jpg"></div><p>Imagine that you photocopied this triangle.
This photocopier is a very special photocopier. Instead of making a
single copy, it shrinks the triangle and makes three copies of
them, positioned inside the original triangle like so. This
photocopier is called a Multiple Reduction Copy Machine- it makes multiple copies, changes their positions in relation to the
original triangle, and reduces their size. Below are the second
iteration triangles.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmintro/images/triangle3.jpg"></div><p>So what happens if you run these three
triangles back through the copy machine? It splits each triangle
into three additional triangles, like the above picture. These are
third iteration triangles. Note that the third iteration triangles
are in the same position in relation to the second iteration
triangles as the second iteration triangles are to the first
iteration triangle.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmintro/images/triangle3a.jpg"></div><p>


</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmintro/images/triangle4.jpg"></div><p>

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmintro/images/triangle5.jpg"></div><p>What if we run the MRCM several times? Say,
twenty? Thirty? Infinitely? We end up with some called Sierpinski
triangle, which looks like the above picture.</p><p>So what does this have to do with
Apophysis's transform editor? Everything! See, Apophysis's
transform editor shows the first two iterations of an MRCM. The
fractal that you see on the screen is what those triangles look
like after, say, 20 or 30 iterations.</p><p></p><p>So, let us make Sierpinski triangle in
Apophysis!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmintro/images/options.jpg"></div><p>Open up Apophysis. Click on the options
button. </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmintro/images/optionsbutton.jpg"></div><p> A window that looks like the picture above will
appear. Click on the Random tab. Set the number of transforms to a
minimum of three and a maximum of three.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmintro/images/options2.jpg"></div><p>Click on the variations tab. Click clear
all, and then check linear. Close the options window.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmintro/images/file.jpg"></div><p>In the main window, go to file, and click
Random batch.</p><p>Chose a random fractal. All of this sets up
the transform editor so that you will be working with the right
number of transforms.</p><p></p><p>now we actually get to make Sierpinski's
triangle.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmintro/images/transformeditor.jpg"></div><p> </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmintro/images/transformeditor6.jpg"></div><p>Open the transform editor. You will see four
triangles. One of them is stationary. It is the base triangle. In
our MRCM up top, it would be the first iteration triangle. It does
not move. The other three, you can click on and move. These are the
second iteration triangles. We call these triangles transforms.
Select the first transform, and click on the transform tab. Change
the weight to .5. Now, select the second transform and change the
weight to .5. Do the same with the third transform. Got that?
Good!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmintro/images/transformeditor3.jpg"></div><p>Now, remember our MRCM at the top? Good.
Arrange the transforms inside the base triangle in the same way the
second iteration triangles are arranged in the first iteration
triangle.</p><p></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmintro/images/transform1.jpg"></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmintro/images/transform2.jpg"></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmintro/images/transform3.jpg"></div><p>You can do this by moving triangles around
or by typing the coordinates in to the triangle tab of the editors.
The coordinates are shown above.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmintro/images/triangle5.jpg"></div><p>Congrats! You've just made
Sierpinski triangle.</p><p></p><p>So what does this tell us about the
transform editor? The Apophysis Transform editor is not a bunch of
random triangles that do cool things. No: these triangles show the
first two steps in an iterated function system. By moving the
triangles around, you are telling how the MRCM is going to copy the
next iteration of triangles.</p><p>Sierpinski triangle is a good example of how
iterated function systems work, because it is a very simple fractal
to make. It is also easy to visualize Sierpinski triangle as
it goes through each iteration, and the last step seems like a
logical extension of the first three triangles. This is because all
we changed was the position and the size of the
triangles.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch02s11.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch03s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">
