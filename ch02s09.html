Variations and Variables
</h2></div></div></div><p>
In the transform editor, it is now time to go to the variations tab

<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="grandjulians/images/variationtab.jpg"></span>.  
Click on it to view its contents. 
The right-hand side of your transform editor will look like the image below:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="grandjulians/images/variationtablinear.jpg"></div><p>
Set the value of the linear variation equal to zero 

<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="grandjulians/images/linearvariationdialog=0.jpg"></span>. 
Then scroll about halfway down the list of variations until you see a variation called Julia, and set it equal to 1 

<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="grandjulians/images/JuliaVariationdialog=1.jpg"></span>.
Do this for two of the transforms.  Make it transforms 2 and 3 to make this tutorial a bit easier- those are the transforms that I'll be doing this to.  
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="grandjulians/images/transformeditordiamond.jpg"></div><p>
It does not matter at all which transforms you actually use, as long as they are in exactly the same position as the yellow and green triangles in the picture above.  This is the part that puts the Julia in Grand Julia. </p><p> Now let's mess with the variations on transforms 1 and 4 (the red triangle and the blue triangles respectively in the picture above).  These are a little more complicated than transforms two and three, because adjusting them involves changing both variations and variables. 
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="grandjulians/images/tran1var.jpg"></div><p>
Select the first transform (The red one in the picture above), and set the Julian to .5 and the Julia variation to 0, as shown in the image above.
</p><p>
    The Julian variation is a slightly modified Julia variation.  For a brief explanation of how it works that doesn't really explain anything, think of Julia and Julian like this:  the Julia variation is a specific, mathematical pattern. Imagine that you took that pattern and made it into a rubber stamp.  Take that rubber stamp, and stamp it around the edges of a circle.  That is more or less what Julian does to the basic Julia equation.  In fact, the reason it is called Julian is because it should really be called Julia-n.  The n stands for the number of Julia patterns that have been stamped around your Julia circle.
</p><p> 
Keep in mind that this is a really awful explanation that does not explain why a Julian does some of the really neat stuff that it does.  But it will serve for this tutorial, and explains why we have to deal with variables.  Julian does not magically know how many times you want to stamp around the circle, so you have to tell it.  While you still have transform 1 selected, go to the variables tab.

<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="grandjulians/images/variablestab.jpg"></span>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="grandjulians/images/var1.jpg"></div><p>
Scroll down until you get to Julian_power and Julian_dist. For the fractal in this example, transform 1's Julian_power should be set to 5 and transform 1's Julian_dist should be set to 1. 
</p><p>
What do these two variables do?  I don't really know for sure.  However, with my long experience I can give you a few pointers about how these variables behave.  
</p><p>
Julian_power tells the fractal how many times to stamp a julia set around the circle.  If you type three, you will notice that the part of your fractal controlled by this transform starts looking more like a triangle, or a three-leaf clover, or something three-ish. If you type five, all of a sudden it's more star-shaped or pentagon-shaped.  However, this is where the stamp metaphor begins to break down.  What happens if you type in two?  Whoops, your fractal begins looking more like a four-leaf clover.  What if you type in 8?  Then the part of the fractal controlled by this transform sprouts eight points.  Moral of the story- odd numbers do more or less what you expect- but even numbers give you twice as much as you expect.
</p><p>
What about Julian_dist?  This one behaves pretty nicely.  Julian_power tells how many vertices the Julian-controlled part of the fractal will have.  Julian_dist tells you how pointy those vertices are going to get.  A value of 1 leaves the image as is. A value of two stretches it to be twice as long as value 1. A value of 3 makes the vertex even pointier.  This is somewhat useful if you are trying to make gear teeth or stars or other things that should be more pointy.  Lowering Julian_dist, however, has some weird effects that I don't know how to explain, so I'm not going to try.  The point is, play with them until you get a feel for how they act in certain situations! 
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="grandjulians/images/tran4var.jpg"></div><p>
Now let's take care of the fourth transform.  Choose the 4th transform.  Set its Julia to .1 and its Julian to .3.  Go to the variables tab.  Set transform 1's Julian_power to 2 and transform 1's Julian_dist to 1.   
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="grandjulians/images/var4.jpg"></div><p>
At this point the fractal in your main screen will look like the one below.  
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="grandjulians/images/transformdiamondwithvariations.jpg"></div><p>
</p><p>
The parameter set for this particular example is here.

The Julia variation is a complex mathematical expression that creates the intricate patterns you see in the fractal above.  It was invented by a fellow called Gaston Maurice Julia, who's work on Julia sets set the stage for Mandelbrot to create his Mandelbrot set and start the whole mathematical love affair with fractals.  He was also a war veteran.  Look him up--he's an interesting character.
