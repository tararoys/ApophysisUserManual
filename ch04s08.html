</p><p>Finally, there are three more color options that I would like to discuss.  Click on the gradient button. 
<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="mrcmcoloring/images/gradientbutton.jpg"></span>
  Now, select the rendering tab, so that the window looks like the window shown below. </p><p>
</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="mrcmcoloring/images/rendering.jpg"></div><p>
</p><p> 
</p><p>  You will see three sliders and a background option.  Let's focus on the sliders first. 

 These control the overall color properties of the fractal.  The gamma generally determines 

how smooth or how pixelated the fractal looks.  I don't have an exact description for what 

gamma does, but I will say that all the fractals I've made with low gamma look horrible and 

the fractals I've made with high gamma look nice and smoothly colored. I always set my 

fractals to a really high gamma. Brightness does just what it says it does: it controls how 

bright the fractal is.  I generally set it low, because high brightness values are usually 

an eyesore.  Don't set it too low, though, or the fractal will disappear entirely.  Now the 

vibrancy controls how well the colors show up.  Having a low vibrancy results in a 

grayscale fractal, while having a high vibrancy results in a rainbow of colors.  I alway 

set my vibrancy to 1, because I like colors.  Finally, look at the background color.  If 

you double-click on the box right next to it, a color picker will show up.  Using it, you 

can choose what color you want the background to be. </p><p>  

</p><p> 


</p><p>So let's review.  One should always use the color slider in moderation.  One should also 

always use symmetry in moderation.  Together, both can result in some fairly interesting 

fractals. The gradient tools are there for having fun.  Use them!   </p><p>
</p><p>I will also leave you with one final thought.  In tutorial 2, you learned how to make 

Sierpinski's gasket.  In this tutorial, you learned how to color Sierpinski's quilt.  Putting 

the two together, can you guess how to make this fractal?</p><p>
